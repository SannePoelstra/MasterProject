Same here, the general shapes are the same, although the proobabilty scale is larger

## **Comparing scores over trials for each condition seperately**

### **Condition 0.00**
A was either Strawberry or Walnut. <br />
B either Peanut or Peach. <br />
X either Shrimp or Wheat.<br />

#### **Original paper graph:** 

![Scores over all 16 trials (plus a pre measure), condition 0.00)](C:/Users/Sanne/Dropbox/MasterProject/Modelling/ScoresPerDay000.png){width=60%}

Note that the pre measure was not taken with the models (since that would just be 0 for all of them). This is also not done in any of the other conditions.

## **Comparing scores over trials for each condition seperately**

### **Condition 0.00**
A was either Strawberry or Walnut. <br />
B either Peanut or Peach. <br />
X either Shrimp or Wheat.<br />

#### **Original paper graph:** 

![Scores over all 16 trials (plus a pre measure), condition 0.00)](C:/Users/Sanne/Dropbox/MasterProject/Modelling/ScoresPerDay000.png){width=60%}

Note that the pre measure was not taken with the models (since that would just be 0 for all of them). This is also not done in any of the other conditions.
